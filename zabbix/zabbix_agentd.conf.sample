#	If IPv6 support is enabled then '127.0.0.1', '::127.0.0.1', '::ffff:127.0.0.1' are treated equally and '::/0' will allow any IPv4 or IPv6 address.
#	'0.0.0.0/0' can be used to allow any IPv4 address.
#	Example: Server=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.0/24,::1,2001:db8::/32,zabbix.domain
#
# Mandatory: yes, if StartAgents is not explicitly set to 0
